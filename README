Test using ckeditor on heroku.

http://rails-admin-ckeditor.heroku.com/

To get it to work on Heroku, disable the ckeditor bit in the config, deploy/db:migrate your app.  Then re-enable the ckeditor bit and deploy that to Heroku and voila, it works.

Perhaps need to raise this as a bug with Heroku... or find another way to do config that is heroku-friendly...
